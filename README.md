## What is VerSe?
Spine or vertebral segmentation is a crucial step in all applications regarding automated quantification of spinal morphology and pathology. With the advent of deep learning, for such a task on computed tomography (CT) scans, a big and varied data is a primary sought-after resource. However, a large-scale, public dataset is currently unavailable.

We believe *VerSe* can help here. VerSe is a large scale, multi-detector, multi-site, CT spine dataset consisting of 374 scans from 300 patients.
